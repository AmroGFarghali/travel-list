# Travel list app

This app features many React Concepts that are used in modern apps

## Design Pattern

Component composition: This applies a seperation of concerns by seperating the logic from the JSX, this helps to make the logic more reusable and and also makes testing the components much easier, since the logic is seperated from the component JSX


## State management Library


I wanted to use a state called items in multiple components without passing props, this is achieved by many state management library including React Context API, however, for learning purposes I used **Zustand**.

Zustand is similar to redux but much more less logic when creating a store!
